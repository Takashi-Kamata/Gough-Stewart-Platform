function varargout = stewart_platform(varargin)
% STEWART_PLATFORM MATLAB code for stewart_platform.fig
%      STEWART_PLATFORM, by itself, creates a new STEWART_PLATFORM or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = STEWART_PLATFORM returns the handle to a new STEWART_PLATFORM or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      STEWART_PLATFORM('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in STEWART_PLATFORM.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      STEWART_PLATFORM('Property','Value',...) creates a new STEWART_PLATFORM or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before stewart_platform_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to stewart_platform_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
