%Calculate the angles for a rotary stewart platform
% This function calculates the coordinates of a stewart platform with given
% geometry. It then uses Inverse kinematics to calculate the needed leg 
% length for the new given position of the platform. After that the needed 
% for six servo motors are calculated. In the end the whole stewart
% platform is plotted in a three dimensional CS.
%
% Throught several input parameter it is possible to define your stewart
% platform and then analyse the range of movement of your design.
%
% Input parameters: 
%       
%       r_B             [m] Radius of the circumcircle of the base hexagon. 
%                           The points where the servo arm is connected to
%                           the servo axis lie on this circle.
%
%       r_P             [m] Radius of the circumcircle of the platform
%                           hexagon. The points where the rod is attached
%                           to the platform lie on this circle.
%       
%       0 [m]    Length of the servo arm. All servo arms  
%                           should have the same length.
%
%       rod_length      [m] Length of the rod connecting the servo arm to
%                           the platform.
%       
%       alpha_B         [rad]   Half the angle between two servos arm    
%                           attachment points. The two servo's arms must  
%                           lie in the same plane.
%
%       alpha_P         [rad]   Half the angle between two rod attachment
%                           points. They also have to be on the same edge
%                           of the platform hexagon.
%
%       trans           [m] The vector which describes the wanted 
%                           translational movement of the platform. 
%                           [x, y, z]
%
%       orient          [rad]   The vector which describes the wanted
%                           rotational movement of the platform according
%                           to the three euler angles [ phi, theta, psi].
